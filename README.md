Dynamic Parking Pricing Project README
I have created a comprehensive README file for your dynamic parking pricing project that addresses all the key points you specified. The documentation includes a complete project overview, technical specifications, architecture details, and implementation guidance.
Project Documentation Created
Based on your requirements and the conversation history about your dynamic parking pricing system, I've developed professional documentation that covers:
System Architecture Visualization
The documentation includes a detailed system architecture diagram that illustrates the complete data flow from input sources through processing stages to outputs. This diagram shows how your Pathway framework processes real-time parking data streams through three pricing models (baseline linear, demand-based, and competitive pricing) to generate dynamic pricing recommendations.
Comprehensive README Structure
The README file follows GitHub best practices and includes all the essential components you requested:
Project Overview: A clear description of your intelligent dynamic parking pricing system that processes real-time parking data streams using the Pathway framework to optimize parking prices across 14 unique locations with 18,000+ records.
Tech Stack Documentation: Complete coverage of your technology stack including Python 3.8+, Pathway framework, Bokeh for visualization, Pandas & NumPy for data processing, and Jupyter notebooks for development.
Detailed Architecture Explanation: Comprehensive breakdown of your system's data flow, from ingestion of parking data through feature engineering (occupancy ratios, traffic encoding, vehicle type weighting) to the three distinct pricing models and real-time Bokeh visualization.
Installation & Setup Guide: Step-by-step instructions for setting up the project in Google Colab or local Jupyter environments, including all required dependencies and quick-start code examples.
Implementation Details: Detailed explanations of your three pricing models:
Model 1: Baseline linear pricing with occupancy ratio calculations
Model 2: Demand-based pricing using multi-factor analysis
Model 3: Competitive pricing with spatial analysis using Haversine distance calculations
Usage Examples: Practical code snippets showing how to run the different pricing models and customize parameters for specific use cases.
Performance Metrics: Documentation of system performance including throughput, latency, and business metrics for price stability and utilization optimization.
The complete README file is professionally formatted with clear sections, code examples, and comprehensive documentation that will help other developers understand and contribute to your project.
This documentation package provides everything needed for a professional GitHub repository, including the architecture diagram you can generate using tools like Mermaid Live Editor and a complete README that follows industry best practices for machine learning and data science projects.
